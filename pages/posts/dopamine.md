title: It's a pattern
date: 2023-11-14

Recently, I've realized that there's an interesting pattern in a subset of _quirky_ things that I do everyday. I think it's easier to spot if I list them:

- Brushing my teeth with my left hand (though I'm right-handed)
- Taking a cold shower
- Always listening to music/podcast
- Run short distances that people normally walk
- Run upstairs over walking
- Never choosing a basic project topic for anything
- ...

The list goes on, and these are just a handful that I've spotted in the past few days. At the core of all these seemingly odd things, I have concluded that I have been seeking stimulation. Mentally, physically, and intellectually, I need a really strong stimulant to make things more _interesting_. This notion of _interesting_ could be taken in multiple directions, but as a student, it comes across the most often as a driver for execution. I have a really hard time doing something that doesn't have these stimulations, but it's so easy for me to suddenly find something really interesting and go down the rabbit hole for hours and hours until the returns diminish significantly. It's also important to note that it's not just the challenge -- it's also the reward that needs to follow through rather quickly. (to be continued)
