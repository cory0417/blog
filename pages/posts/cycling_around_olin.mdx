## Introduction

As part of my "passionate pursuit", I've decided to explore and share cycling routes around [Olin College of Engineering](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i4eodvRR2Ue1jSHG7). I've been cycling around Olin for a while now -- anywhere from a 5 minute ride to Wellesley College to a 3 hour loop around towns like Dover, Sherborn, and Medfield. I've been using Strava to track my rides, and I'm going to use this post as a way to share some of my favorite routes. By doing so, I'm hoping to inspire others to explore the area and enjoy the beautiful scenery that surrounds Olin, as well as make cycling more accessible to the community.

### Context

I'm a 23-year-old male with a diverse set of fitness background (running, climbing, weightlifting, swimming, calistenics, hiking, etc.) so please keep that in mind when you're reading through this post. I've been cycling casually for about 16 years now mostly as a mode of transportation, but I've been doing it more seriously since the past summer. I've done metric centuries, and some hard climbs (check out Wari La, Ladakh, India at 5,300 m!), but by no means am I a great/experienced cyclist.

As a student without a car, I've cycled to get groceries, get to events, commute to work, as well as for fun. I'm mainly going to share some routes that are longer than 10 miles since those are the most intimidating if you aren't sure what the road will actually look like beyond Google maps (or other route planners). I'll also share some tips on how to make your ride more enjoyable, and some things to keep in mind when you're out on the road.

## Routes

It was a challenging route, but I enjoyed every moment of it.
